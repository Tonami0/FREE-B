        OFFBEAT ONES
    </h3>

    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        This is a website created for all people who are being misunderstood or underlooked by the world. 
        I wish everyone using this website could find their own way to be unique themselves and be treated gentle by the world.
    </p>

    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        You can treat this website as anything you want it to be. A Encyclopedia about some "strange things", an Art gallery, or just a Place to share your thoughts, experiences, ect.
    </p>

    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
       Even though there might be no real "empathy" in this world, I still hope that the world can accept as much people as possible.
    </p>

    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        Here is some examples of whot does "Offbeat Ones" mean, in case you are wondering:
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        1. 16 Personalities
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        Every different personality is very unique and special. But people with different personalities usually have really different or even opposite ways of thinking. And that always cause a lot of misunderstanding and conflicts between people.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        2. People with mental illness
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        People with mental illness are usually misunderstood by the world. They are often treated as "crazy" or "weird" by the world. They should be treated with more warmth but accually they are often treated coldly.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        3. People with different sexual orientation
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        Many people even don't know that there are more than 2 sexual orientations, let alone understand those people with different sexual orientations. 
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        4. People with different genders
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        Many people even do not know there is people with different genders. But acctually, there is more than 35 kinds of genders in theory. And only 2 of them are accepted by the world, which is really a tragedy.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        5. People who are introverted or always be alone
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
       I really want to say "it is not your fault" to those people. That is just because their special characteristics. In every group of people, there must be someone who is not good at socializing and conveying his or her self. And that is totally normal.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        6. Those people who have very small minority of interests or hobbies
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        Many of those unique interests or hobbies are really interesting and worth to be known. But because of the small minority of people who are interested in them, they are often ignored by the world. Many of them have to quit their hobbies because of the lack of people who are interested in them or those interests are not being accept and understand by other people.
    </p>

    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        I hope that this website can help those people, let more and more people get to know them on this plateform, and let the world accept them. 
    </p>
