        OFFBEAT ONES
    </h3>

    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        This is a website created for all people who are being misunderstood or underlooked by the world. 
        I wish everyone using this website could find their own way to be unique themselves and be treated gentle by the world.
    </p>

    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        You can treat this website as anything you want it to be. A Encyclopedia about some "strange things", an Art gallery, or just a Place to share your thoughts, experiences, ect.
    </p>

    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
       Even though there might be no real "empathy" in this world, I still hope that the world can accept as much people as possible.
    </p>

    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        Here is some examples of whot does "Offbeat Ones" mean, in case you are wondering:
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        1. 16 Personalities
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        Every different personality is very unique and special. But people with different personalities usually have really different or even opposite ways of thinking. And that always cause a lot of misunderstanding and conflicts between people.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        2. People with mental illness
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        People with mental illness are usually misunderstood by the world. They are often treated as "crazy" or "weird" by the world. People's stereotypes make these people who should be warmed get more indifference.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        3. People with different sexual orientation
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        Because of the fixed mindset in whole society, many people think that people whose sexual orientation in different from the traditional ones are "abnormal". However, sexual orientation is largely derived from biology, which is a thing that is destined almost at birth. 
        Broadly, there are 4 types of sexual orientation, heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality, and asexuality (the lack of sexual attraction to others).
        When it comes to sexual identity, there are more labels such as "pansexuality" and "polysexuality".
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        4. People with other genders except males and females
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        Many people even do not know there is people with different genders in the world. Though the fact is that there are 35 genders in theory of biological sex and social gender, and there are 56v gender choices available to users on Facebook, only 2 of them are accepted by the world, which is really a tragedy.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        5. People who are introverted or always be alone
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
       I really want to say "it is not your fault" to those people. And it not anyone's fault. That is just because their special characteristics. In every group of people, there must be someone who is not good at socializing and conveying his or her self. And that is totally normal. So don't doubt yourself or rack your brains to please others. You can choose to spend more time doing things that you really enjoy doing.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        6. Those people with niche interests or hobbies
    </p>
    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        Actuallty, I'm one of those people and I spent a lot of time painfully finding the meaning of myself and the hobbies I'm participating in. Many of those unique interests or hobbies are really interesting and worth to be known. 
        But because of the scarce minority of people who knows them, those interests are often ignored by the world. Many of them have to quit their hobbies because of the lack of people who are interested in them or those interests are not being accept and understand by other people.
    </p>

    <p style="color: #abc8e2; font-family: Monospace; font-size: 16px; align-items:center">
        I hope that this website can help those people, let more and more people get to know them on this plateform, and let the world accept them. 
    </p>
